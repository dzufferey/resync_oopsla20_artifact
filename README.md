# 424. Programming at the Edge of Synchrony

Documentation to reproduce the experiments from the paper "Programming at the Edge of Synchrony"

## Scope of the Artifact

This artifacts explain how to run ReSync and the other tools against which we compare.

### Software Setup

This repository only contains the explanation about how to install and run other tools, as well as scripts and configuration files to facilitate this task.

We have tested the tools with Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions.
As we use external project, we install them separately from their source to guarantee they have not been tampered.

### Hardware Setup

Running the experiments requires having access to 9 machines.
It is possible to run on fewer machines by running multiple processes on the same machine but this will affect the results.

The performance numbers will vary depending on the deployment and requires tuning some parameters.
If you want to witness ReSync running the machines used to get the numbers in the paper, please contact Damien Zufferey (zufferey@mpi-sws.org) for a demonstration.

PSync and ReSync have the same codebase.
As Psync is a special case of ReSync, they share the same runtime.
PSync is just a specific set of progress condition in ReSync.
This is implemented in the file `src/main/scala/psync/Round.scala`.
A `Round` is the PSync model and an `EventRound` is the ReSync model.
It is possible to get some of the benefit of ReSync with `Round` by overriding `expectedNbrMessages`.
We will use that option when comparing PSync and ReSync.


## Getting Started Guide


1. Install clusterssh (optional but really helpful later)
2. Install dependencies
3. Clone the artifact repo
4. Install PSync
5. Install LibPaxos3
6. Install etcd
7. Install Goolong
8. Install Bft-SMaRt

Except for clusterssh, all the other tools should be installed on all the machines running the tests.
clusterssh is installed on the machine the perform running the tests.

### Install clusterssh

Usually, running a test is done by issuing the same command to all the machines participating in the test.
`clusterssh` allows you to send commands to all the machines at the same time (or a subset of the machines).
This greatly helps running the tests.
```sh
sudo apt install clusterssh
```

Then put the addresses of the machines you will use in `.clusterssh/clusters`.
For instance, the file may contain
```
resync srv-76-164.mpi-sws.org srv-76-165.mpi-sws.org srv-76-166.mpi-sws.org srv-76-167.mpi-sws.org srv-76-168.mpi-sws.org srv-76-169.mpi-sws.org srv-76-117.mpi-sws.org srv-76-118.mpi-sws.org srv-76-119.mpi-sws.org
```
In the rest of this artifact, we will use these machines names as placeholder.

Then you can connect to all the machines with
```
cssh resync
```

From now on, you should connect to the test machines and the rest of the setup occurs there.

### Install dependencies

The tools we use have some external dependencies and we group their installation here.
Here are the command to intall the dependencies.

* Utils:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install curl wget git zsh
  ```
* C: these are the dependencies for LibPaxos3.
  ```sh
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake libevent-dev libmsgpack-dev
  ```
* Java: Bft-SMaRt and PSync need Java
  ```sh
  sudo apt install default-jdk ant
  ```
* Scala: PSync needs scala on to of java. [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) takes care of building everything.
  ```sh
  echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
  curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install sbt
  ```
* Go is needed for etcd and Goolong
  etcd requires a fairly recent version of go.
  If you use Ubuntu 20.04, you can do
  ```sh
  sudo apt install golang
  ```
  If you use debian stable, you need to install go manually:
  ```sh
  wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.14.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
  echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

### Clone the artifact repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dzufferey/resync_oopsla20_artifact.git
cd resync_oopsla20_artifact
export RESYNC=$PWD
echo "export RESYNC=$PWD" >> .bashrc
```

The last line adds the `RESYNC` environment variable to the `.bashrc` file.
So if you disconnect and reconnect to the machine the variable will always be defined.

#### Setting the addresses for the machines

The artifact contain scripts that help you run the tools.
These script needs to know about the addresses of the test machines that you use.

The script `$RESYNC/set_replicas.sh` performs this configuration step.

First, modify the script to insert the information about your machines.
The script contains `TODO` comments above the part you need to modify.

After you are done with the modifications, just run the script:
```sh
$RESYNC/set_replicas.sh
```

To check that the script worked properly you can run
```sh
$RESYNC/findId.sh
```
The command should ouput the ID of the replica, a number between 0 and 8.


### Install PSync

This covers both ReSync and PSync.

1. Installing and build PSync:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dzufferey/psync.git
   cd psync
   sbt compile
   sbt test:compile
   ./utils/generateClassPath.sh
   ```
2. Local test run, part 1
   ```sh
   ./test_scripts/testLV.sh
   ```
   The test runs for about 1 minute and the output should looks like
   ```
   running 3 LV replicas for 60 seconds
   stopping ...
   #instances = 211178, Δt = 58, throughput = 3641
   #instances = 211285, Δt = 58, throughput = 3642
   #instances = 211189, Δt = 58, throughput = 3641
   ```
   It is likely that the test will produce warnings like
   ```
   [Warning] @ TcpRuntime: Couldn't connect, trying again...
   [Warning] @ Algorithm: processPool is running low
   ```
   during the run and after `stopping ...` there can be outputs like
   ```
   [Warning] @ TcpRuntime: Tried to send packet to 1, but no channel was available.
   java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed
   ```
   Warnings are harmless and serves as indication of places when the runtime can be improved (better resource managemenet, graceful shutdown, etc.).

   On recent version of java, you may see
   ```
   WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
   WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.esotericsoftware.kryo.util.UnsafeUtil (file:/home/zufferey/.cache/coursier/v1/https/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/esotericsoftware/kryo-shaded/4.0.2/kryo-shaded-4.0.2.jar) to constructor java.nio.DirectByteBuffer(long,int,java.lang.Object)
   WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.esotericsoftware.kryo.util.UnsafeUtil
   WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
   WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
   ```
   This can also be ignored.
   The library we use for serialization ([twitter chill](https://github.com/twitter/chill)) uses some deprecated features of the JVM.
2. Local test run, part 2
   ```sh
   ./test_scripts/testTempByzantine.sh
   ```
   The test runs for about 1 minute.
   Similar as before it can produce a fair amount of output and errors _after `stopping ...`_.
   This test checks that secure connection can be established between replicas.
   If this fails with errors related to java security, this can usually be fixed by editing the `.jvmopts` in the psync folder and adding the following lines:
   ```
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStoreType=JKS
   ```
